# Plate-Armor-Plus
Replaces Iron Armor With Plate!
Huge credit to Askywalker, as he originally made the pack and a few things such as a couple textures were originally his, but heavily edited by Me.
Be sure to check out to the original pack for Minecraft 1.16.3 here! (It Still works on 1.19.3!)
And some credit to Notch, as he created the Original Plate Armor Texture. Not that important in the scope of things he's made though....

If you report any bugs on any version, please dm me with info. Thanks!
